# Computational Biology Starter Kit

Welcome to the **Computational Biology Starter Kit**! This repository aims to help scientists, especially those new
to computational biology, get started with the essential tools, skills, and best practices in the field. Whether
you're a biologist interested in coding or a computational enthusiast diving into biology, this guide provides
a structured path to help you begin your journey.

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

- Basics of version control with Git and GitHub
- Navigating the Unix command line
- Introduction to scripting with Python and R
- Best practices for reproducibility in computational biology
- Workflow management and automation tips

## Learning Path

### 1. **Getting Started with Git and GitHub**

- **Why Learn This?** Version control is crucial for managing your code, collaborating with others, and maintaining
reproducibility in your research.
- **Topics to Cover:**
    - Basic Git commands (`init`, `clone`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`)
    - Creating and managing repositories on GitHub
    - Branching, merging, and resolving conflicts
    - Writing good commit messages and maintaining a clean commit history
- **Best Practices:**
    - Commit often with descriptive messages.
    - Use branches for new features or experiments.
    - Regularly sync with the main branch and keep it stable.

### 2. **Navigating the Unix Command Line**

- **Why Learn This?** The command line is the backbone of many computational biology workflows, allowing you to
automate tasks, manage files, and run bioinformatics software.
- **Topics to Cover:**
    - Basic commands (`ls`, `cd`, `mv`, `cp`, `rm`, `grep`, `find`)
    - File permissions and environment variables
    - Writing and executing simple bash scripts
    - Data manipulation with `awk`, `sed`, and `cut`
- **Best Practices:**
    - Always back up your data before running destructive commands.
    - Use comments in scripts to document your code.

### 3. **Introduction to Python**

- **Why Learn This?** Python is a versatile language widely used in data analysis, machine learning, and bioinformatics.
- **Topics to Cover:**
    - Basic syntax, data types, and control structures
    - Libraries for data analysis (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`)
    - Bioinformatics libraries (`Biopython`, `scikit-bio`)
    - Writing functions and organizing code into modules
- **Best Practices:**
    - Write clean, readable code with meaningful variable names.
    - Use virtual environments to manage dependencies (`venv`, `conda`).

### 4. **Introduction to R**

- **Why Learn This?** R is especially powerful for statistical analysis and data visualization, often used in genomics
 and other biology-related data analysis.
- **Topics to Cover:**
    - Basic syntax and data structures
    - Data visualization with `ggplot2`
    - Data manipulation with `dplyr` and `tidyverse`
    - Writing reproducible reports with R Markdown
- **Best Practices:**
    - Keep scripts organized and well-commented.
    - Use R projects for organizing related scripts and data.

## Best Practices for Computational Biology

- **Reproducibility:** Document your workflows and use version control for code and data. Consider using Jupyter
notebooks, R Markdown, or similar tools to create reproducible research documents.
- **Data Management:** Keep raw data unchanged and well-documented. Use clear naming conventions for files.
- **Coding Standards:** Follow PEP 8 (Python) or Tidyverse style guide (R) for code readability.
- **Collaboration:** Use GitHub issues, pull requests, and project boards to manage work and collaborate effectively.
